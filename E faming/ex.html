            Climate:
            The Kharif season varies by crop and region, starting at the earliest in May and
            ending at the latest in January. In India, the season is popularly considered to
            start in June and end in October. Kharif crops are usually sown at the beginning
            of the first rains during the advent of the south-west monsoon season, and they
            are harvested at the end of monsoon season (Octoberâ€“November).
            Monsoon sowing dates vary, occurring toward the end of May in the southern
            state of Kerala and reaching July in some north Indian states. In other regions
            like Maharashtra, the west coast of India, and Pakistan, which receive rains in
            June, Kharif crops are sown in May, June and July. In Bangladesh, Kharif crops
            are usually sown with the beginning of the first rains in June.
            These crops are dependent on the quantity of rainwater as well as its timing.
            Too much, too little, or rain at the wrong time may lay waste to the whole year's
            efforts.
            Soil:
            Loamy soil, black soil and red soil are best for kharif crops.
